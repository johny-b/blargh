BLARGH
=============

.. module:: blargh

Create a RESTful service with as little effort as possible - answer few questions:

1. What is your data model?
2. Where do you want to store the data? (recommended answer: PostgreSQL)
3. What web app framework do you want to use? (recommended answer: Flask)

and **blargh** will take care of the rest. Or at least it will try.
